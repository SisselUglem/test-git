                    to get started with the education Front End Developer at Sundsgårdens Folkshögskola.<br>
                     I live in Härjedalen, which is one of Sweden's most sparsely populated municipalities.<br>
                      My main interests are graphic design and outdoor life. Two very different areas,<br>
                      which provides a good contrast in my everyday life.

                        not just as a hobby but with deeper knowledge.<br>
                        I believe that Sundsgården's education can give me what I need to succeed.
